# Functions
Currently there is only one function. whatever put into the funtion params will output to the console log.
```
var nPoP = require"muhpackage"

var N = new nPoP()

N.pop
```

The ouput will be whatever is passed into muhpackage()


<br>
You can also write the function:

```
ok()
```
to output a second function to the console log.
